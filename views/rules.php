      <p>The players must remain the required number of measures away from the front of the bin at all times, or that throw is deemed a 'no-throw' and classed as a failed attempt.</p>

      <h2>2.3. Scoring points</h2>

      <p>If the player is successful in getting the ball into the bin, he/she will receive some points. The number of points awarded is equal to the number of measures away from the bin, minus the number of failed attempts.</p>
      <p>The ball must stay in the bin to be classed as a successful throw. If the ball bounces out is is classed as a failed attempt and no points are awarded</p>
