      <p>We ask players to register with Facebook as this allows us to store gameplay statistics, and track the usage of BinBall.</p>
      <p>Using Facebook means a quick registration process for you guys whilst we get everything we need to get you started. We only ever store your name and email address, and promise not to spam you with un-necessary emails or post anyting on your Facebook account without your knowledge - in fact, you will probably never hear from us again.</p>
      <p>Once you have registered you can use our handly online scorecard to score your games, keeping track of all of your in-game statistics.</p>
      <p>We do not require that every player register with BinBall, just one registered player is required in order to start a game. From there, new players can be added to games with no further registration required.</p>
